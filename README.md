FireTray - patched for KDE
=======

**[THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED](https://foudil.fr/blog/209/the-web-is-not-the-platform/)**

Overview
--------

This is a fork of [foudfou/FireTray](https://github.com/foudfou/FireTray)

The original FireTray has been "brutally" patched to display the number of unread messages in KDE system tray.

It is a workaround for issues:
* [foudfou/FireTray #143](https://github.com/foudfou/FireTray/issues/143)
* [foudfou/FireTray #210](https://github.com/foudfou/FireTray/issues/210)
